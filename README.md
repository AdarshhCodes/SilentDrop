# SilentDrop 🧠💻

*A mindful developer burnout & work-pattern analyzer*

SilentDrop is a full-stack web application that analyzes a developer’s GitHub activity to surface **work patterns, burnout risk, and behavioral trends** — without judgment.

Instead of tracking productivity, SilentDrop focuses on **sustainability**:
when you work, how often you push late nights or weekends, and whether your recent rhythm signals strain.
